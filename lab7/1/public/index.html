                <b>A pet, or companion animal</b>, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or
entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular
pets are often considered to have attractive/cute appearances, intelligence, and relatable
personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray
animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.
